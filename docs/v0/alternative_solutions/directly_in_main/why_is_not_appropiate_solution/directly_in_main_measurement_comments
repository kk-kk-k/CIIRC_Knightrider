Why is this solution not the right one

Please have look at corersponding image interrupt_measurement

As you can see, in ../Src/main.c we setup tim6 config to the following:
Period: 71
Prescaller: 0
F CPU: 72 MHz

Frequency of tim6 interrupt is computed via this formula:
	f = f_cpu / (prescaller + 1) / (period + 1)
After adding values, our formula looks like this:
	f = 72MHz / (0 + 1) / (71 + 1) = 1MHz
	
However, in out measurement picture, we can see both that
	1) Output frequency is cca 295 kHz, which is both
		- too slow for camera (we want about 1 MHz)
		- it does not match frequency configured for tim6 (1 MHz)
			- probably, the code execution takes more time than one timer period, which causes refresh frequency being smaller
