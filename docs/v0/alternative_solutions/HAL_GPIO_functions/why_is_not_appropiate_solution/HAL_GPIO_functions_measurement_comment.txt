Why is this solution not the right one

Please have look at corresponding image HAL_GPIO_functions_measurement.png

This time, the biggest error in our LED signal is caused by HAL function HAL_GPIO_WritePin
	1) In ../Src/main.c, the followind code is executed
	
		file: ../Src/main.c, line 107
			// turn off old LED
			HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LED_PORT, puiGpioLedPins[iCurrentLed], GPIO_PIN_RESET);

			// increment current led index
			if (++iCurrentLed == 2)
				iCurrentLed = 0;

			// turn on new LED
			HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LED_PORT, puiGpioLedPins[iCurrentLed], GPIO_PIN_SET);
			
		In other words, this code produces following:
			1) reset old pin
			2) increment LED
			3) set new pin
			
		As you can see, incrementing LED index takes time. That causes setting and resetting pins being done in different time, which is not good.
			- Maybe we could compute this in cameras, but that is not needed, as writing to ODR register (via DMA or manually) causes practically immediate switch of LED states practically simultaneously

	3) Signal is not fast enough
		- We need LED frequency around 1 MHz, 660 kHz is not enough
		- HAL_GPIO_WritePin checks if PinState is set or reset state. This operation takes extra time. This computation is done automatically and much faster by DMA
